<div id="About">
	<p>
		design makes me smile.<br>
		and I'm all about being happy.<br>
		this is the driving force behind all of my actions.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		great colors make my day.<br>
		I whole-heartedly believe waht Louise Fili once told me,<br>
		"if you wouldn't wear it together, you shouldn't design with it together."<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		my inspirations can come in any form:<br>
		fashion, food, photography, travel, physical activity, literature, and fine art<br>
		all the things I love send me on a different path in design.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		I believe in setting goals, working hard, and never giving up.<br>
		I'm an organizer, <a href="http://strangemaryjane.tumblr.com/">blogger</a>, and the self-proclaimed chef of my kitchen, aside from being an artist.<br>
		every explerience I've had brough me to where I am right now, and I bring that to my designs.<br>
